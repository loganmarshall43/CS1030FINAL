            <h2>Species Overview</h2>
            <p>Order Artiodactyla; Family Cervidae; Genus Cervus; Species C. canadensis<br> Elk will live in higher elevations during the summer and lower elevetions during the winter. As a stronger, larger bodied animal they are able to dig though ice and snow with some effeciency to graze more food during the winter months, but with larger herd sizes and diet needs they can clear an entire area of winter feed quickly and will need to move more often.</p>

            <h2>Hunter's Perspective</h2>
            <h3>Trophy Qualities</h3>
            <p>Trophy hunters typically hunt male elk called "bulls". Trophy qualities are identified as length of main beam, amount of points, length of points and mass of antler structure.</p>

            <h3>Food Source Value</h3>
            <p>A signle elk could feed a small family for 6 months or more. These animals are often hunted as a primary meat source and are well known for their similarity to beef.</p>

            <h3>Difficulty & Permit Access</h3>
            <p>Demand for permits is high with Elk. It is often not easy to secure a permit to hunt them and most people feel very lucky to hunt either a male or female elk.</p>

            <h2>Predation & Population Management</h2>
            <h3>Predators & Threats</h3>
            <p>Wolves are an elk's main threat. Not many other predators will bother an elk once it's out of it's first few weeeks of infancy. CWD and habitat reduction remains an elks most prominant threat.</p>

            <h3>Population Regulation Needs</h3>
            <p>Elk can overpower a landscape quickly as they don't have many natural predators and the birth survival rate is quite high. As long as water and food remains constant, elk will prosper.</p>

            <h3>Hunting Justification</h3>
            <p>Human intervention will always be needed to keep the elk population balanced enough for a landscape to support multiple species.</p>
