            <h2>Species Overview</h2>
            <p>Order Artiodactyle; Family Bovidae; Genus Ovis; Species O. canadensis (Rocky Mountain/ Desert Sub-species).<br> Sheep herds will often find a place in high barren cliffs to dwell permanently. Roaming only when food/water runs out.</p>

            <h2>Hunter's Perspective</h2>
            <h3>Trophy Qualities</h3>
            <p>Hunting is almost exclusively for male sheep known as "Rams". Trophy qualities include horn mass and curl length.</p>

            <h3>Food Source Value</h3>
            <p>Food source is considered a delicacy. Not a ton of meet is secured off of a mature ram, but what meat can be taken is usually valued highley among hunters and family.</p>

            <h3>Difficulty & Permit Access</h3>
            <p>Probably the most exclusive hunt in the United States. Harvesting a sheep is considered a "once-in-a-lifetime" opportunity in most states.</p>

        <section id="management-info">
            <h2>Predation & Population Management</h2>
            <h3>Predators & Threats</h3>
            <p>Everything is an enemy to sheep. High transfer of disease and small slow bodies make them a very sensative species. It's often wondered how they made it this far without going extinct. In many places without human intervention sheep would no longer exist.</p>

            <h3>Population Regulation Needs</h3>
            <p>Population needs to be regulated to slow the spread of disease. Hunting also raises money to keep sheep alive through water an habitat projects.</p>

            <h3>Hunting Justification</h3>
            <p>Not enough sheep permits are issued to consider hunting a population managment tactic. Instead hunting a sheep is so expensive that water an habitat are built from money that is paid to hunt a sheep.</p>
