            <h2>Species Overview</h2>
            <p>Mule deer, order Artiodactyla; Family Cervidae; Genus Odocoileus; Secies O. heminus. <br> Mule deer are an on the move species, taking their herd to higher ground during the summer months to enjoy cooler temperatures and better feed and spending the winter months on the low ground. <br> Common feed types are grasses, oak brush, bitter brush, and will even make special efforts to get into farmer/residential crops if available.</p>

            <h2>Hunter's Perspective</h2>
            <h3>Trophy Qualities</h3>
            <p>Trophy hunters most commonly hunt male deer referred to as "bucks". Trophy size is indicated by horn width, mass and amount of points.</p>

            <h3>Food Source Value</h3>
            <p>Mule deer make a great food source for a family. It's a very lean red meat that makes great stews, roasts and burger meat.</p>

            <h3>Difficulty & Permit Access</h3>
            <p>Mule deer populations are constantly monitored and in most states the amount of hunting permits given out are a direct reflection of that population count.<br> In dry desert states the permit numbers will be lower becasue population is much more sensitive to change than in forested areas.</p>

            <h2>Predation & Population Management</h2>
            <h3>Predators & Threats</h3>
            <p>Predators include: Mountain lions, coyotes, and bears. <br>Other threats are: Habitat loss, CWD (Chronic Wasting Disease), and vehicle strikes.</p>

            <h3>Population Regulation Needs</h3>
            <p>The landscape has a hard time sustaining Mule deer populations through the winter in many areas. Populations must be regulated to keep a healthy amount of food during the winter months.</p>

            <h3>Hunting Justification</h3>
            <p>Hunting Mule deer can be justified across the western US as most deer populations are not well regulated through natural predation, and the spread of disease can be kept at bay by keeping populations down.</p>
